## Hey, there! You can call me Tina. ðŸ˜€

I'm a Master's graduate in Physics with a thesis in Astrophysics ðŸŒƒâœ¨. My major research interests are observational cosmology, epoch of reionization and the early universe. I also share interests in theoretical astrophysics and extragalactic astronomy. 

Currently, I'm looking for a full-time PhD position in Astrophysics.
