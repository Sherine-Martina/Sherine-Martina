I'm a Master's graduate in Physics holding a thesis in Astrophysics ðŸŒƒâœ¨. My major research interests are observational cosmology, epoch of reionization, first galaxies/quasars and the early universe. I also share interests in theoretical astrophysics and extragalactic astronomy. 

Currently, I'm looking for a full-time PhD position in Astrophysics.
